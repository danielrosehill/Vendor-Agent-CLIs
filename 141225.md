Amazon Q Developer is AWS's agentic coding assistant built on Amazon's own foundation models (including Amazon Titan and Nova). It offers CLI access for code generation, transformation, and debugging tasks. Q Developer integrates tightly with AWS services and is particularly strong for cloud infrastructure work—it can generate CloudFormation templates, suggest IAM policies, and help with AWS SDK usage. The tool also includes software composition analysis for security vulnerabilities and supports autonomous code transformation tasks like Java version upgrades. Available through AWS's ecosystem with tiered pricing based on usage.

## Claude Code (Anthropic)

At the time of writing, Claude Code is probably the best known of the vendor-created agentic CLI tools, and has quickly developed the strongest ecosystem around it in the form of plugin marketplaces and other tooling and add-ons.

Claude Code reportedly emerged as an experimental internal tool at Anthropic and is regarded by many as the gold standard in agentic AI tools. It scores consistently impressive results on various benchmarks.

The entrenchment of Claude Code as the go-to in the space owes a lot to the fact that Anthropic has spearheaded the development of MCP (Model Context Protocol) and has focused particularly on tooling.

Claude Code is currently available on higher paid tiers of Claude. Higher usage limits are available on Max subscriptions. It can also be used via the Anthropic API. My personal experience from using it across these different subscription models is that at my high level of usage, the API costs were actually significantly higher than the cost of my monthly subscription.

## Codex (OpenAI)

Codex is OpenAI's agentic code development tool. It's offered as part of the ChatGPT ecosystem and can also be consumed via OpenAI's API. Codex operates as a cloud-based agent that can execute code in a sandboxed environment, browse the web, and work with files. It's designed to handle multi-step coding tasks autonomously, including writing tests, fixing bugs, and proposing pull requests. OpenAI positions Codex as a software engineering agent capable of working on tasks in the background while developers focus on other work.

## Gemini CLI (Google)

Gemini CLI is Google's command-line interface for interacting with Gemini models. It provides agentic capabilities for code generation, debugging, and general development tasks. The CLI integrates with Google's broader AI ecosystem and can leverage Gemini's multimodal capabilities. It's available through Google AI Studio and can be used with various Gemini model versions. Google has positioned Gemini CLI as part of their developer tooling suite, with tight integration into Google Cloud services.

## Groq Code CLI (Groq)

**Website:** [https://github.com/build-with-groq/groq-code-cli](https://github.com/build-with-groq/groq-code-cli)

Groq Code CLI is a lightweight, customizable open-source coding assistant that runs in your terminal, powered by Groq's fast AI inference. Unlike larger, more complex CLIs, Groq Code CLI intentionally keeps its codebase lean and approachable for developers who want to modify and extend it. It includes built-in slash commands for managing sessions and model selection, and supports tool extensibility where AI can call custom functions. The philosophy emphasizes making the foundation accessible enough that developers can genuinely understand and extend it rather than dealing with enterprise-scale complexity.

## Kimi CLI (Moonshot AI)

**Website:** [https://github.com/MoonshotAI/kimi-cli](https://github.com/MoonshotAI/kimi-cli)

Kimi CLI is Moonshot AI's agentic coding assistant, powered by the Kimi K2 model—a state-of-the-art mixture-of-experts (MoE) language model with 32 billion activated parameters and 1 trillion total parameters. Kimi CLI functions not only as a coding agent but also as a shell; users can switch to shell command mode by pressing Ctrl-X to run commands without leaving the CLI. It supports MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools and can be integrated with Zsh to enhance the shell experience with AI agent capabilities. Kimi K2 achieves 65.8% pass@1 on SWE-bench Verified tests, making it competitive with top-tier models for agentic coding tasks.

## Mistral CLI (Mistral AI)

**Website:** [https://github.com/mistralai/mistral-cli](https://github.com/mistralai/mistral-cli)

Mistral recently released its own CLI, leveraging its Devstral models specifically optimized for code generation and agentic development workflows. Devstral is designed as a lightweight but capable coding model that can run efficiently on local hardware. Mistral's CLI focuses on privacy-conscious development, allowing developers to run the agent locally rather than relying on cloud infrastructure. The tool supports standard agentic operations like file editing, code generation, and shell command execution.

## Qwen Code (Alibaba)

**Website:** [https://qwenlm.github.io/](https://qwenlm.github.io/)

Qwen Code is Alibaba's agentic coding assistant built on the Qwen model family. It offers code generation, completion, and explanation capabilities. Qwen models are notable for their strong multilingual support (particularly for Chinese) and competitive performance on coding benchmarks. The tooling is available through Alibaba Cloud's Model Studio and supports both API access and local deployment options for the open-weight Qwen models.
