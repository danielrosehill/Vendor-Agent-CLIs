My impression using vendor issues CLI is to date compared to using the same model through API endpoints is that the vendor maintain models are often and I would say usually more performant. I've noticed enhanced stability and more robust tool calling and better handling of context. I am, however, a sample size of one, and I'm not sure to what extent this might be attributable to the maturity of tools over time, regardless of how they are accessed. Nevertheless, I thought it would be worth discussing. Can you point to any objective reasons why first party maintains CLI tooling might be more useful than that accessed through 3rd parties, even when the API provider might be the company itself>
