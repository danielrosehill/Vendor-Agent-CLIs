# Vendor-Managed AI Agent CLIs

*Dec 14, 2025*

This repository curates a list of command line interfaces for AI models that are maintained by the model vendors themselves.

Vendor CLIs are often offered as standalone interfaces and sometimes integrated into IDEs—whether those maintained by the vendors or as official plugins for mainstream IDEs like VS Code.

A common pattern has emerged: Vendors create CLI accompaniments to their models that are primarily pitched to the developer community. The tools remain fairly elementary until they "hit it big" and develop a cult following among a loyal user base. An ecosystem begins to develop naturally around the tools. Eventually, media attention follows.

The distinction between vendor-managed and third-party CLIs is made not to suggest that vendor-created tools are necessarily inherently better than third-party tooling that leverages models via APIs. But there are specific reasons why many regard them as more significant. The most important of these is first-party access to the model upon which they are based. This close tie-in with model development often yields more reliable performance than that which can be accessed through external tooling.

Given that creating and releasing a commercial LLM with agentic tooling remains a substantial undertaking, the number of vendor-maintained CLIs is actually a fairly narrow pool.

However, as with everything else in agentic AI, that list changes frequently as new tools come to market. Therefore, the lists are maintained in timestamped documents.
